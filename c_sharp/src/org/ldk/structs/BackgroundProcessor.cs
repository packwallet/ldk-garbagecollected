/**
 * `BackgroundProcessor` takes care of tasks that (1) need to happen periodically to keep
 * Rust-Lightning running properly, and (2) either can or should be run in the background. Its
 * responsibilities are:
 * Processing [`Event`]s with a user-provided [`EventHandler`].
 * Monitoring whether the [`ChannelManager`] needs to be re-persisted to disk, and if so,
 * writing it to disk/backups by invoking the callback given to it at startup.
 * [`ChannelManager`] persistence should be done in the background.
 * Calling [`ChannelManager::timer_tick_occurred`], [`ChainMonitor::rebroadcast_pending_claims`]
 * and [`PeerManager::timer_tick_occurred`] at the appropriate intervals.
 * Calling [`NetworkGraph::remove_stale_channels_and_tracking`] (if a [`GossipSync`] with a
 * [`NetworkGraph`] is provided to [`BackgroundProcessor::start`]).
 * 
 * It will also call [`PeerManager::process_events`] periodically though this shouldn't be relied
 * upon as doing so may result in high latency.
 * 
 * # Note
 * 
 * If [`ChannelManager`] persistence fails and the persisted manager becomes out-of-date, then
 * there is a risk of channels force-closing on startup when the manager realizes it's outdated.
 * However, as long as [`ChannelMonitor`] backups are sound, no funds besides those used for
 * unilateral chain closure fees are at risk.
 * 
 * [`ChannelMonitor`]: lightning::chain::channelmonitor::ChannelMonitor
 * [`Event`]: lightning::events::Event
 * [`PeerManager::timer_tick_occurred`]: lightning::ln::peer_handler::PeerManager::timer_tick_occurred
 * [`PeerManager::process_events`]: lightning::ln::peer_handler::PeerManager::process_events
 * BackgroundProcessor will immediately stop on drop. It should be stored until shutdown.

	/**
	 * Start a background thread that takes care of responsibilities enumerated in the [top-level
	 * documentation].
	 * 
	 * The thread runs indefinitely unless the object is dropped, [`stop`] is called, or
	 * [`Persister::persist_manager`] returns an error. In case of an error, the error is retrieved by calling
	 * either [`join`] or [`stop`].
	 * 
	 * # Data Persistence
	 * 
	 * [`Persister::persist_manager`] is responsible for writing out the [`ChannelManager`] to disk, and/or
	 * uploading to one or more backup services. See [`ChannelManager::write`] for writing out a
	 * [`ChannelManager`]. See the `lightning-persister` crate for LDK's
	 * provided implementation.
	 * 
	 * [`Persister::persist_graph`] is responsible for writing out the [`NetworkGraph`] to disk, if
	 * [`GossipSync`] is supplied. See [`NetworkGraph::write`] for writing out a [`NetworkGraph`].
	 * See the `lightning-persister` crate for LDK's provided implementation.
	 * 
	 * Typically, users should either implement [`Persister::persist_manager`] to never return an
	 * error or call [`join`] and handle any error that may arise. For the latter case,
	 * `BackgroundProcessor` must be restarted by calling `start` again after handling the error.
	 * 
	 * # Event Handling
	 * 
	 * `event_handler` is responsible for handling events that users should be notified of (e.g.,
	 * payment failed). [`BackgroundProcessor`] may decorate the given [`EventHandler`] with common
	 * functionality implemented by other handlers.
	 * [`P2PGossipSync`] if given will update the [`NetworkGraph`] based on payment failures.
	 * 
	 * # Rapid Gossip Sync
	 * 
	 * If rapid gossip sync is meant to run at startup, pass [`RapidGossipSync`] via `gossip_sync`
	 * to indicate that the [`BackgroundProcessor`] should not prune the [`NetworkGraph`] instance
	 * until the [`RapidGossipSync`] instance completes its first sync.
