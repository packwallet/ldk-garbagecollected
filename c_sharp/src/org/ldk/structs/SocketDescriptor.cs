 * has been disconnected, the [`PeerManager`] has been informed of the disconnection (either by it
 * having triggered the disconnection or a call to [`PeerManager::socket_disconnected`]), and no

 * use a file descriptor for your SocketDescriptor directly, however for simplicity you may wish
 * to simply use another value which is guaranteed to be globally unique instead.
